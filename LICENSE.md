🚀 Verilog SPI Master Module - Design & Simulation in ModelSim 🎯
Excited to share my Verilog-based SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) Master module! 🖥️🔬 Designed and simulated using ModelSim, this project ensures efficient serial data communication for embedded and VLSI applications.

🛠️ Key Features:
✅ 4-bit SPI Master implementation for serial communication
✅ Bit-wise data transmission via MOSI (Master Out Slave In)
✅ Slave Select (SS) control for accurate data exchange
✅ Finite State Machine (FSM)-based design for efficient operation
✅ ModelSim testbench validation to verify functionality

🔗 Technologies Used:
🔹 Verilog HDL – SPI Master module design
🔹 ModelSim – Simulation & debugging
🔹 Finite State Machine (FSM) – Ensures precise data handling

📌 Project Overview:
This project implements an SPI Master module that transmits data bit-by-bit using MOSI, SCLK, and SS signals. The design is based on a finite state machine (FSM), ensuring correct state transitions and seamless communication with SPI Slave devices.

The testbench simulates SPI transactions in ModelSim, verifying correct timing and data flow. This is a step toward low-power, high-speed serial communication for embedded and VLSI applications.
